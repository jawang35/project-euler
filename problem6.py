Problem 6 - Sum Square Difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square
of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the
square of the sum.
